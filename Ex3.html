	<p>Alice's "Adventures in Wonderland" commenced on July 4, 1864, as British writer Lewis
		Caroll was accompanying the three daughters of fellow writer, Henry Liddel on a leisure trip. 
		That day, Caroll told the girls a story, which were "Alice's Adventures Under Ground".
		At young Alice Liddel's request, the story was written down, two years later
		a full manuscript was completed. Over hundred years later, the book would inspire numerous
		adaptions, including a whimsical Disney tale in 1951.
